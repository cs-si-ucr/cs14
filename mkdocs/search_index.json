Each item in a list ADT is called a \nnode\n.\n\n\nSingly-linked Lists\n\n\nSingly-linked lists is a data structure for implementing a list ADT, where each node has a data and a pointer to the next node. The list structure typically has pointers to the list's first node and last node. The list's first node is called the \nhead\n, and the last node is the \ntail\n.\n\n\n\n    The head in this case would be the node with value 12 and the tail would be the node with value 37\n\n\nIn order to implement a Linked List, you must define the structure\nfor an individual node.\n\n\nFor a singly-linked list of integers, it may look something like:\n\n\nstruct IntNode{\n    int val;\n    IntNode* next;\n};\n\n\n\n\nIn order to implement the Linked List, we store the head of the list,\nwhich is a pointer to a \nIntNode\n.

Both of these return an iterator to different\npositions in the vector container. Both also return an\niterator of type \nvector<int>::iterator\n.\n\n\nvec.begin()\n returns an iterator to beginning of \nvec\n. However, \nvec.end()\n returns an iterator to the element \none past\n the last element.\n\n\nThis is pictured below (image from en.cppreference.com)\n\n\n\nA lot of algorithms in the STL, including \nstd::sort\n\nexpect iterators as arguments. \n(and usually specific types of iterators)\n\n\nOne of the function prototypes for \nstd::sort\n looks\nsomething like this:\n\n\ntemplate<typename RandomIt>\nvoid sort(Iterator first, Iterator last);\n\n\n\n\nAs long as we provide the sort function valid iterators, it will sort\nthe elements within the range [first, last).\n\n\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\n#include <algorithm>\nusing namespace std;\nint main() {\n    vector<int> vec {42, 8, 3};\n\n    // sort all of the elements in vec in ascending order\n    sort(vec.begin(), vec.end());\n\n    /*\n        We can use auto to omit the type\n        on the left-hand side in C++11!\n\n        Also, this is a way to iterate through a\n        vector using iterators with a for-loop!\n    */\n    for(auto vec_iter = vec.begin(); vec_iter != vec.end(); vec_iter++){\n        cout << *vec_iter << ' ';\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\n`\n\nTry it yourself - before compiling guess what the above program outputs.\n\n\nThat's cool and all, but what if we want to sort the\ncontainer in descending order: function objects come\nto the rescue!\n\n\nFunction Objects\n\n\nBack in CS12, you learned that you can \noverload\n\nspecial operators while defining classes. The prototype\nof a method of a rational number class which overloads the\n\n+\n operator may look like this (assume the \ngcd\n function is defined):\n\n\nbool operator+(const Rational & other) {\n    int new_denom = gcd(this -> denom, other.denom);\n    int this_multipler = new_denom/(this -> denom);\n    int other_multipler = new_denom/(other.denom);\n    int new_numer = this_multipler  * this -> numer +\n                    other_multipler * other.numer;\n    return Rational(new_numer, new_denom);\n}\n\n\n\n\nYou can also overload the function call operator by\ndefining a function with the function name \noperator()\n.\n\n\ne.g.\n\n\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nclass Counter {\n    public:\n        Counter() :count(0) {}\n        Counter(int count) : count(count) {}\n        void operator() () {\n            ++count;\n        }\n        int get_count() {\n            return count;\n        }\n    private:\n        int count;\n};\nint main() {\n    Counter count;\n    count();\n    count();\n    cout << count.get_count() << endl;\n}\n\n\n\n\nTry it yourself - before compiling guess what the above program outputs.\n\n\nOverloading the function call operator automatically makes the\nclass a \"function object\". This becomes useful in a number of\nSTL algorithms. Some of the algorithms include \nstd::sort\n\nand \nstd::copy_if\n. The most common types of\nfunction objects that these algorithms accept as input are\n\ncomparison function objects\n which return\ntrue if the first argument is \nconsidered\n less than the second and\na unary predicate which returns true if it satisfies some condition.\n\n\n#include <iostream>\n#include <algorithm>\n#include <vector>\n#include <list>\nusing namespace std;\n\nclass SortGreater {\n    public:\n        bool operator() (const int & a, const int & b ) const {\n            return a > b;\n        }\n};\n\nclass IsEven {\n    public:\n        bool operator() (const int & x) const {\n            return x % 2 == 0;\n        }\n};\n\nint main() {\n    vector<int> from_vector {1, 2, 3, 4};\n    list<int> to_list(2);\n\n    sort(from_vector.begin(), from_vector.end(), SortGreater());\n    for (int elem : from_vector) {\n        cout << elem << ' ';\n    }\n    cout << endl;\n\n    copy_if(from_vector.begin(), from_vector.end(), to_list.begin(), IsEven());\n\n    for (int elem : to_list) {\n        cout << elem << ' ';\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nTry it yourself - before compiling guess what the above program outputs.\n\n\nExercise 1 - Reverse Polish Notation\n\n\nReverse Polish notation (RPN)\n is a mathematical notation in which every operator follows all of its operands. It is also known as postfix notation and does not need any parentheses as long as each operator has a fixed number of operands.\n\n\nIn reverse Polish notation the operators follow their operands; for instance, to add 3 and 4, one would write \"3 4 +\" rather than \"3 + 4\". If there are multiple operations, the operator is given immediately after its second operand; so the expression written \"3 \u2212 4 + 5\" in conventional notation would be written \"3 4 \u2212 5 +\" in RPN: 4 is first subtracted from 3, then 5 added to it.\n\n\nAn advantage of RPN is that it removes the need for parentheses that are required by infix. While \"3 \u2212 4 * 5\" can also be written \"3 \u2212 (4 * 5)\", that means something quite different from \"(3 \u2212 4) * 5\". In postfix, the former could be written \"3 4 5 * \u2212\", which unambiguously means \"3 (4 5 * ) \u2212\" which reduces to \"3 20 \u2212\"; the latter could be written \"3 4 \u2212 5 * \" (or 5 3 4 \u2212 * , if keeping similar formatting), which unambiguously means \"(3 4 \u2212) 5 * \".\n\n\nYour task is to implement a reverse polish notation calculator that reads in an equation and calculates the result.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\n\n\nInput: 5 1 2 + 4 * + 3 -\n\n\nOutput: 14\n\n\n\n\nFor this exercise, implement the calculator using your choice of list.\n\n\nCool References\n\n\nStandard Template Library Video Series by Stephan T.

(and usually specific types of iterators)  One of the function prototypes for  std::sort  looks\nsomething like this:  template<typename RandomIt>\nvoid sort(Iterator first, Iterator last);  As long as we provide the sort function valid iterators, it will sort\nthe elements within the range [first, last).  #include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\n#include <algorithm>\nusing namespace std;\nint main() {\n    vector<int> vec {42, 8, 3};\n\n    // sort all of the elements in vec in ascending order\n    sort(vec.begin(), vec.end());\n\n    /*\n        We can use auto to omit the type\n        on the left-hand side in C++11!\n\n        Also, this is a way to iterate through a\n        vector using iterators with a for-loop!\n    */\n    for(auto vec_iter = vec.begin(); vec_iter != vec.end(); vec_iter++){\n        cout << *vec_iter << ' ';\n    }\n}  ` Try it yourself - before compiling guess what the above program outputs.  That's cool and all, but what if we want to sort the\ncontainer in descending order: function objects come\nto the rescue!",

            "text": "Back in CS12, you learned that you can  overload \nspecial operators while defining classes. The prototype\nof a method of a rational number class which overloads the +  operator may look like this (assume the  gcd  function is defined):  bool operator+(const Rational & other) {\n    int new_denom = gcd(this -> denom, other.denom);\n    int this_multipler = new_denom/(this -> denom);\n    int other_multipler = new_denom/(other.denom);\n    int new_numer = this_multipler  * this -> numer +\n                    other_multipler * other.numer;\n    return Rational(new_numer, new_denom);\n}  You can also overload the function call operator by\ndefining a function with the function name  operator() .  e.g.  #include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nclass Counter {\n    public:\n        Counter() :count(0) {}\n        Counter(int count) : count(count) {}\n        void operator() () {\n            ++count;\n        }\n        int get_count() {\n            return count;\n        }\n    private:\n        int count;\n};\nint main() {\n    Counter count;\n    count();\n    count();\n    cout << count.get_count() << endl;\n}  Try it yourself - before compiling guess what the above program outputs.  Overloading the function call operator automatically makes the\nclass a \"function object\". This becomes useful in a number of\nSTL algorithms. Some of the algorithms include  std::sort \nand  std::copy_if . The most common types of\nfunction objects that these algorithms accept as input are comparison function objects  which return\ntrue if the first argument is  considered  less than the second and\na unary predicate which returns true if it satisfies some condition.  #include <iostream>\n#include <algorithm>\n#include <vector>\n#include <list>\nusing namespace std;\n\nclass SortGreater {\n    public:\n        bool operator() (const int & a, const int & b ) const {\n            return a > b;\n        }\n};\n\nclass IsEven {\n    public:\n        bool operator() (const int & x) const {\n            return x % 2 == 0;\n        }\n};\n\nint main() {\n    vector<int> from_vector {1, 2, 3, 4};\n    list<int> to_list(2);\n\n    sort(from_vector.begin(), from_vector.end(), SortGreater());\n    for (int elem : from_vector) {\n        cout << elem << ' ';\n    }\n    cout << endl;\n\n    copy_if(from_vector.begin(), from_vector.end(), to_list.begin(), IsEven());\n\n    for (int elem : to_list) {\n        cout << elem << ' ';\n    }\n}  Try it yourself - before compiling guess what the above program outputs.",

            "text": "Reverse Polish notation (RPN)  is a mathematical notation in which every operator follows all of its operands. It is also known as postfix notation and does not need any parentheses as long as each operator has a fixed number of operands.  In reverse Polish notation the operators follow their operands; for instance, to add 3 and 4, one would write \"3 4 +\" rather than \"3 + 4\". If there are multiple operations, the operator is given immediately after its second operand; so the expression written \"3 \u2212 4 + 5\" in conventional notation would be written \"3 4 \u2212 5 +\" in RPN: 4 is first subtracted from 3, then 5 added to it.  An advantage of RPN is that it removes the need for parentheses that are required by infix. While \"3 \u2212 4 * 5\" can also be written \"3 \u2212 (4 * 5)\", that means something quite different from \"(3 \u2212 4) * 5\". In postfix, the former could be written \"3 4 5 * \u2212\", which unambiguously means \"3 (4 5 * ) \u2212\" which reduces to \"3 20 \u2212\"; the latter could be written \"3 4 \u2212 5 * \" (or 5 3 4 \u2212 * , if keeping similar formatting), which unambiguously means \"(3 4 \u2212) 5 * \".  Your task is to implement a reverse polish notation calculator that reads in an equation and calculates the result.  Example:   Input: 5 1 2 + 4 * + 3 -  Output: 14   For this exercise, implement the calculator using your choice of list.",
