Lab 5: Binary Tree Applications
===================================

To do this excercise, first type into your terminal the following command:
`git clone https://github.com/Andre-Castro/cs14`. You should now see a folder with multiple .h,
.o and one main.cpp file.

Exercise 1 - Arithmetic Expression Trees
----------
Using the files provided for you from the git clone, we will be working with an arithmetic expression tree
(If you have had lab for this week, yes it is the same arithemetic expression trees you will be using in lab!).

Create a function `evaluate()` that takes the expression and evaluates the result.
For example, given the expression: `"1+5/2*4+3-1"`, the evaluation shold return 10 (using integer division).

Excercise 2 - Huffman Trees
----------
For the following excercises we will be working with the dowlonaded Huffman Tree files.
