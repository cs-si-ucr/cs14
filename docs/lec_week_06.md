Part I: AVL Trees
==============================

The following questions are in regards to AVL Trees. If you have't done the 
reading for this chapter, I suggest skipping Part I and attempting Part II.

**Question 1**<br>
What is the relationship between the balance factor of a node and the height
of the node's children?

**Question 2**<br>
What is the relationship between the balance factor and the direction of
rotation when rebalancing?


The following questions are in regard to the AVL Tree below.

**Question 3**<br>
Mark the height and balance factor for each node.

**Question 4**<br>
What does the tree look like after the following operations? Be sure to
draw the relevant sections of the tree after each operation.<br>
> `tree.insert(33);`<br>
> `tree.insert(26);`<br>
> `tree.insert(37);`<br>
>` tree.insert(39);`<br>
