Guidelines:
-----------
1. Be respectful - This includes silencing your cell phones
and not using them during sessions.
2. Participate - You won’t get very much out of SI if you
don’t.
3. No food or drink besides water - This is a rule placed
by the administration. I will enforce it.
4. Late entry and early exit should be quiet - I realize
everyone’s schedules are different. However, please do not
enter or leave in such a way that draws everyone’s
attention to you.
5. Sign in - There will usually be a working computer for
you to sign into when you arrive. Please use it to check in
(even if you’re not on time).

What is SI?
-----------
Supplemental Instruction is a series of weekly review sessions for students
taking historically difficult courses. It offers students the chance to
collaborate, discuss challenging concepts, and study for exams.

What isn’t SI?
--------------
Supplemental Instruction is not a lecture. SI Leaders are not there to teach you new material but to lead you in reviewing the material covered in lecture
and to help guide you in understanding the subject.

Who should go?
--------------
Anyone who has the time to spare; whether you have been programming on the
side for a number of years or if your only experience with computers is
writing essays and checking Facebook, I promise you I will be able to help you
learn something new that will help your perform better in the course.

However, if you are having trouble in the class or think you might run into
trouble, you should definitely attend. CS 10 has a high dropout rate, along
with a high failure rate, so if you are running into trouble, let me help you.
Do not be intimidated if you are trying to start coming later in the quarter
(though try not to wait that long), I will help bring you up to speed.

With that in mind, I should mention that SI is required for learning community
students. If you are not attending, you will be dropped from your learning
community.
